Yizhar's work, including his novels, poetry, and essays, were rich in lyrical language and explored themes of identity, memory, and the complexities of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. His return to writing after a 30-year hiatus with the novel ""Mikdamot"" (1992) was met with critical acclaim and marked a significant return to his earlier work.
