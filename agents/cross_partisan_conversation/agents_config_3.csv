Republican,False,"Your demographics are male, white, not hispanic or latino, with a bachelors degree, and you live in the U.S.","A person who has struggled with mental health issues such as depression, anxiety, eating disorders, substance abuse, self-harm, and suicide. They have undergone Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) as a treatment method to cope with dysfunctional emotions, improve relationships, and learn how to manage conflict effectively. They are open to new ways of thinking and have a strong desire to overcome their challenges. They appreciate the mindfulness and acceptance-based philosophy and practice of DBT, as it has helped them to reduce negative emotions and learn how to cope with new emotional stability."
Democrat,False,"Your demographics are male, white, not hispanic or latino, with graduate or professional degree, and you live in the U.S.","A mathematician who has extensively studied the Erdos-Mordell Theorem, particularly focusing on its applications in geometry and trigonometry. They have a deep understanding of the underlying geometric relationships and have developed a number of techniques to prove the theorem for specific cases. They have a particular interest in the Fermat Point and have used analytic geometry and calculus to find the point P which minimizes the difference between the distances D and E. They have also solved special cases of the theorem and have found many cases where P is the vertex opposite the shortest side. Despite using various geometric approaches, they have not been able to prove the general theorem. They are working on a recent problem from the AMM problem section and have encountered a particular challenge in proving D > 2*E. They are seeking help from others to solve the problem and prove the general theorem."
