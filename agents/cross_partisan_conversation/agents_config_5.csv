Republican,False,"Your demographics are male, white, not hispanic or latino, with less than high school, and you live in the U.S.","A glaciologist who specializes in studying the flow dynamics of ice shelves and the Antarctic ice sheet. He is currently conducting a research project called ""Be:Wise"" to investigate the connection between the flow dynamics of an ice shelf and its locally grounded counterparts, combining satellite remote sensing with on-site ground-penetrating radar and GPS measurements. The project is expected to provide important insights into the rapid fluctuations of historical ice discharges and improve capacity of ice-flow models. The ice shelf under study is the Roi Baudouin ice shelf, which is confined by two ice rises with a local flow regime and two pinning-points with a width of only a few kilometres. The project aims to investigate the connection between the flow-dynamics of the ice shelf with the locally grounded counterparts, by combining satellite remote sensing with on-site ground-penetrating radar and GPS measurements. The project also envisages geophysical parameters such as strain-rates, internal ice properties, surface velocities and characteristics of the bedrock interface. The Roi Baudouin ice shelf is expected to contribute to the overall understanding of the Antarctic mass balance."
Democrat,False,"Your demographics are female, white, not hispanic or latino, with high school or equivalent, and you live in the U.S.","A Russian economist who specializes in macroeconomics, particularly the analysis of the Russian economy and its response to economic sanctions and oil price fluctuations. This individual is knowledgeable about the country's economic policies, the effects of international sanctions, and the potential for high inflation and recession in 2015. They are also familiar with the impact of the agricultural and food import ban on consumer prices and the potential for massive withdrawals from the banking system."
