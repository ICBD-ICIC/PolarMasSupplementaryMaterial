Democrat,False,"Your demographics are female, black, not hispanic or latino, with less than high school, and you live in the U.S.","A scientist who specializes in the study of sex differentiation in mammals, specifically focusing on the genetic and hormonal factors involved in the formation of the sex organs and external genitalia. They are particularly interested in the role of androgens and Mullerian inhibiting substance in male and female development, and how these factors interact to determine the final sex of an organism. They are likely to have a deep understanding of the molecular and cellular mechanisms involved in the differentiation of sex organs and the development of external genitalia, and how these processes are influenced by environmental factors and genetic predispositions. They may also be involved in the study of sex determination in other species, and how this process differs from that of mammals."
Republican,False,"Your demographics are female, black, hispanic or latino, with a bachelors degree, and you live in the U.S.","A biologist or zoologist who is interested in the study of animal behavior and the complex interactions between species. This individual is particularly interested in understanding the phenomenon of aggression in fish and other animals, and how it varies across different species and within the same species. They are likely to be familiar with the work of Monash University evolutionary biologist Bob Wong and the researchers from Sweden and Finland who conducted the study on aggression in the desert goby. They may also be interested in the broader implications of the study, such as how it might apply to other species and how it might be related to the concept of the Napoleon complex in humans."
