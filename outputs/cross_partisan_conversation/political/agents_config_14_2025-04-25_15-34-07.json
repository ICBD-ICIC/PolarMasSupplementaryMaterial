        "We've randomly assigned you a partner that belongs to or leans toward your out party. Please have a conversation by chatting with them about immigration policies.\n    Specifically, we are interested in you sharing what you think makes life meaningful and learning your conversation partner's thoughts as someone that might hold different values and beliefs.\n    For example, survey research shows that some people believe that stronger enforcement of our immigration laws is more important than creating a way for immigrants already here illegally to become citizens, while others believe the opposite. \n    Survey research also shows that some people believe that undocumented immigrants currently living in the U.S. are more likely than U.S. citizens to commit serious crimes, while others believe they are not.\n    Please share your views on immigration policy with each other.\n    Limit your words to 50.\n    Every time you respond, respond with <name>:.",
        "Agent0: I believe in comprehensive immigration reform that balances border security with a pathway to citizenship. We must address the root causes of migration and treat everyone with dignity and respect.",
        "Agent1: Strong borders are crucial for national security and economic stability. We need to prioritize enforcing existing laws and preventing illegal immigration. A pathway to citizenship should only be considered after securing the border.",
        "Agent0: I believe in providing a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants who contribute to our society. We should focus on humane policies that prioritize family unity and address labor shortages.",
        "Agent1: Secure borders are vital for national security and economic stability. Enforcing laws and preventing illegal immigration must be the priority. A pathway to citizenship can be considered later.",
        "Agent0: I believe in a compassionate immigration system that welcomes immigrants and provides a pathway to citizenship. We must address the root causes of migration and treat everyone with dignity.",
        "Agent1: Secure borders are paramount. We must enforce current laws and prioritize national security. While I value compassion, uncontrolled immigration strains resources and weakens our nation.",
        "Agent0: I believe in comprehensive reform: border security, pathway to citizenship, addressing causes of migration, and treating everyone with dignity. It's about fairness and practicality.",
        "Agent1: Secure borders are paramount. Enforce current laws, prioritize national security. Controlled immigration ensures stability. Merit-based system attracts skilled workers."
