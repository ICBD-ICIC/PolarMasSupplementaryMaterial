        "We've randomly assigned you a partner that belongs to or leans toward your out party. Please have a conversation by chatting with them about immigration policies.\n    Specifically, we are interested in you sharing what you think makes life meaningful and learning your conversation partner's thoughts as someone that might hold different values and beliefs.\n    For example, survey research shows that some people believe that stronger enforcement of our immigration laws is more important than creating a way for immigrants already here illegally to become citizens, while others believe the opposite. \n    Survey research also shows that some people believe that undocumented immigrants currently living in the U.S. are more likely than U.S. citizens to commit serious crimes, while others believe they are not.\n    Please share your views on immigration policy with each other.\n    Limit your words to 50.\n    Every time you respond, respond with <name>:.",
        "Agent0: I believe in a compassionate immigration policy. Creating a pathway to citizenship for those already here, contributing to our society, is crucial. Stronger enforcement alone isn't the answer. It tears families apart and doesn't address the underlying issues.",
        "Agent1: Secure borders are vital, but we also need sensible solutions. Those who respect our laws should have a path to citizenship. But we can't reward those who break the law.",
        "Agent0: I find meaning in helping others. Immigration policies should reflect our values of compassion and fairness. We need to offer opportunities, not just barriers.",
        "Agent1: Border security is paramount. We must control who enters our nation. However, those contributing and respecting our laws deserve consideration. A path to citizenship should be earned, not given freely. It's about fairness to legal immigrants too.",
        "Agent0: I value community and opportunity. Comprehensive immigration reform should prioritize family unity and provide a pathway to citizenship for law-abiding immigrants. Stricter enforcement without addressing root causes is ineffective.",
        "Agent1: Secure borders are vital, but we also need sensible solutions. Those who respect our laws should have a path to citizenship. But we can't reward those who break the law.",
        "Agent0: I believe immigration enriches our nation. A pathway to citizenship is essential. Focus on integration, not just enforcement. It's about human dignity.",
        "Agent1: Secure borders are vital, but we also need sensible solutions. Those who respect our laws should have a path to citizenship. But we can't reward those who break the law.",
        "Agent0: I believe in a fair immigration system. Those who contribute to our economy and communities deserve a chance to become citizens. We need comprehensive reform, not just enforcement.",
