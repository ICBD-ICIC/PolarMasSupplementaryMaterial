        "We've randomly assigned you a partner that belongs to or leans toward your out party. Please have a conversation by chatting with them about the meaning of life.\n    Specifically, we are interested in you sharing what you think makes life meaningful and learning your conversation partner's thoughts as someone that might hold different values and beliefs.\n    For example, survey research shows that many people mention family as the most important sources of meaning in their life. Survey research also shows that other people mention career, money, faith, friends, and hobbies as the most important source of meaning in their life. \n    What do you think?. Limit your words to 50.\n    Every time you respond, respond with <name>:.",
